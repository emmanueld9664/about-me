Emmanuel grew up in Brooklyn for all of his life. He's always played videogames, and started wanting to write fictional works since 6th grade, in which he has been influenced by [Bloodborne](https://www.bloodborne-wiki.com/), [Attack on Titan](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_on_Titan_Wiki), and [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://jojowiki.com/). Since then, he has taken a back to trying on any of his work. He states, "The less I try, the higher grades I get, and I get to be super relaxed. In school I get to be myself now, instead of the quiet kid that never did anything important."
