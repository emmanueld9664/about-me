Emmanuel grew up in Brooklyn for all of his life. He's always played videogames, and started wanting to write fictional works since 6th grade. Since then, he has taken a back to trying on any of his work. He states, "The less I try, the higher grades I get, and I get to be super relaxed. In school I get to be myself now, instead of the quiet kid that never did anything important."
